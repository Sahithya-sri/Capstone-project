This is the capstone project that I have completed from professional program in data analytics course from NIIT , this project was completely involved with the tools like excel, SQL, python and tableau significantly where all these tools were used to complete this project named as " UNLEASHING FOOTBALL DATA INSIGHTS" Using multiple tools learnt during the course time . So basically this project was listed with 10 business objectives and I was supposed to create 2 business related questions for each objective and present each objective with 2 visualizations each using popular visualizations tools like python and tableau , even consisted of merging 5 different excel sheets into one single sheet with the help of python and excel and involved SQL for imputing and checking for tables and finally concluded with tableau dashboard creation and power point presentation which summarises the key objective findings and conclusions.
